## Context

Space Ambush is a mini game developed as part of a fundraising strategy for The Mater Foundation, the official charity of The Mater Public Hospital. Space ambush is a form of rich content for the charity's subscriber list, and redirects at different points to the donation page for the hospital. It's based off Whack-A-Mole, formerly an extremely popular arcade and today browser based game type, which tests the players reflexes by challenging them to hit multiple disappearing targets within a set time limit.

## Project Goals

1. To positively engage the subscriber list of The Mater Foundation with a new, fun and unexpected form of outbound marketing - the branded mini game!

2. To generate donations for The Mater Foundation through new and return visits and playthroughs of the game from existing and potentially also from new supporters.

### Design
<span id="design"></span>

#### Project Inspiration
<span id="inspiration"></span>
#### Yellowbelly Beer Branded Minigame - Hop Rocket

The major inspiration for this mini game (also listed in credits) is from an Irish craft beer company that developed a video game as part of their outbound marketing [Hop Rocket by Yellowbelly Beer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7G-gFBJzVk)

![Hop Rocket by Yellowbelly](./assets/images/design-choices/brand-minigame.png)

While this game is no longer available for play, it was an inspired way of engaging potential customers beyond the world of product shots, and behind-the-scenes marketing.

The craft beer company had minimum impact on Space Ambush in terms of functionality and presentation, but a big impact in terms of design concept.

#### Dovile Krasnickaite - Whack-A-Monster

The other major inspiration for this project was from a fellow student from the Code Institute diploma. Their name is Dovile Krasnickaite, and their project was similarly based on the Whack-A-Mole game.

![Dovile Krasnickaite - Whack-A-Monster](./assets/images/design-choices/whack-a-monster.png)

Their project showed how great user experience could revitalise a game from 1970s arcades.

#### Memory Improvement Tips - Whack-Em-All

A further inspiration came from Memory Improvement Tips and their browser version of Whack-A-Mole; especially in terms of game logic and game rule designs.

![Memory Improvement Tips - Whack-Em-All](./assets/images/design-choices/whack-em-all.jpg)

I loved how they introduce a penalty click with the mole-bomb, and force the user to make choices between different, simultaneously appearing moles on the basis of scopre points.


#### Color Scheme
<span id="color"></span>

- The theme of the game is futuristic, alien fun and quick reflexes. So the color palette includes bright, vibrant colors to promote light entertainment and good eye-hand coordination.

The Space Ambush color palette listed above is derived from digital assets designed by artist Robert Brooks, and purchased with Pro License on https://www.gamedevmarket.net

#### Typography
<span id="type"></span>
- Roboto Slab is the main body font used throughout the website, with Sans-Serif as the fallback font. The thick cut, futuristic design helps create the setting for this arcade-based, space game.

- Exo 2 is used for headings, and is similarly a thick cut, futuristic font. Perfect for a slightly retro-arcade, space game feel!

#### Imagery
<span id="imagery"></span>

- All digital assets used in this 2D Whack-A-Mole game were originally designed by Robert Brooks, and purchased with Pro Liense on https://www.gamedevmarket.net

- These assets have been revised in Adobe Illustrator to remove the appearance of facing sideways, and to provide Whack-A-Mole style animations!

**1. Menu screens**

| Menu    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Main Menu | Requests user nickname, provides access to options and leaderboard menus                                                                                                                                     |
| Options | Provides choice on difficulty levels to the player                                                                                                                                              |
| Scoreboard  | Shows a list of my highest 5 scores.

**2. Difficulty Levels**

- Space Ambush can be played in easy, normal or hard mode.
    * In easy mode, players must click or tap a randomly appearing monster. If they don't, they are attacked and lose points.
    * In normal mode, players are presented with two monsters; the first provides more points if hit, the second cost more points if not hit.
    * In hard mode, players are presented with two monsters and a bomb. They face the same conundrum as normal mode, but if they click the bomb they lose all their points.

**3. Scoreboard and Use of Cookies**

- The player's nickname and high scores are saved to their local storage and will display on the scoreboard on return to game, providing cookies are not deleted.

- A player will not be actively asked to make a donation after they are first asked at the end of their first playthrough, but the donate button in nav bar will remain as a passive ask on the home screen and game over screen.

**4. Score Generated Comments**

- Every time a player reaches a certain threshold with their score, they unlock a score generated comment. This feature is to encourage replay value, as scores deemed of low value generate a tease comment, and as the score climbs, the tone changes gradually to one of increased admiration.

**5. Visual effects**

- Every time a player makes a menu choice, clicks on an alien monster, or fails to click on a monster in time a visual effect is programmed as a result. Monsters turn red when they attack, and yellow when they're hit, and a modal generates when the game is over. At every stage of user experience, visual effects are used to give feedback.

**7. Responsive/intuitive input**

- The game can be controlled with either a mouse or touch-screen tap gestures

- When the game loses focus (e.g. when the player clicks on another browsing tab or switches apps), it pauses to prevent a frustrating end to the game.

**8. Audio**


**9. Minigame Marketing**

- The business goal for the mini game is to generate donations from subscribers and supporters of The Mater Foundation.

- On initial completion of the game, users will be prompted to consider making a donation to The Mater Foundation. On clicking yes, they're redirected the charity's donation form.

- Returning players will not be actively solicited for further donations, but the donate button will remain as a passive ask in nav bar on home page and game over screen.

### Future
<span id="features-future"></span>

**Leaderboard**

- Recording scores from different players on an overall leaderboard, which would add considerably to replayability value.

**Add Level Selection to Game Options**

- Different alien planet with differently patterned ambushes, and aliens.
- The primary difference would be graphical, adding to ease of implementation.

    * ![Screenshot of full performance report from Google Chrome Developer Tool Lighthouse.](./mater-foundation/assets/images/lighthouse-report.jpg)   

### User Stories Testing

Most common path through the existing Mater Foundation website:

* Home > Donate
* Home > Volunteer is the anticipated most common path based on this data.
* Home page therefore has 2 large, colourful call to action buttons to volunteer

The latest news and patient stories part of the website are the second most frequented, and offer 2 calls to action each.

* Home > Patient-1 > Patient-2 > Etc
* Home > Patient-1 > Volunteer

Similarly,

* Home > News-1 > News-2 > News-3 > Etc
* Home > News-1 > Newsletter Sign-Up

### Testing User Stories from UX Section of ReadME

### Bugs Discovered & Resolved

#### Dropdown Box

![Image of first bug, which caused empty box to appear underneath dropdown menu](./mater-foundation/bug-shots/bug-one.jpg)


1. Custom Navbar Dropdown Issues
    * When I first implemented a customized css snippet for my navbar dropdown menu, I noticed that it was generating an additional empty box under right under the parent menu item.
    * To solve the problem of this empty box, I located the point it was being generated (although not the source) and targeted that point with CSS reducing it to null

```
/* Customized CSS Snippet for Navbar from https://inspirationalpixels.com/creating-a-dropdown-menu-with-html-css/ */

.navbar-nav .nav-item ul {
    position: absolute;
    top:100%;
    left:0px;
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0;
    opacity: 100%;
    z-index: 1;
}

.navbar-nav .nav-item ul li {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    list-style-type: none;
}

/* .customized CSS Snippet from https://inspirationalpixels.com/creating-a-dropdown-menu-with-html-css/*/

/* Additional CSS required to fix bug in that snippet */

div.dropdown-menu.show {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    border: 0;
}

/* .additional CSS required to fix that snippet bug */

```

2. Custom Modal Issues

![Image of second bug, which caused empty box to appear underneath dropdown menu](./mater-foundation/bug-shots/bug-two.jpg)

    * When I initially tested my custom modal it displayed fine. However, when I tried to enter information into the fields, I couldn't click on it. In fact, clicking on it dismissed it.
    * To solve this, I spent ages reading through the potential problems and solutions. But I realized when customizing the snippet I had removed key functionality.

```
<!-- Customized modal from Bootstrap/Whiskey Drop Module -->

    <div class="modal" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" id="newsletter-modal">
        <div class="modal-dialog" role="document">
            <div class="modal-container bg-light">
                <div class="cancel-wrapper">
                  <button type="button" class="close cancel" data-dismiss="modal" aria-label="Close">
                            <span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span>
                    </button>
                    </div>
                    <form class="newsletter-modal">
                        <div class="modal-heading-wrapper">
                            <h4 class="heading">Newsletter Sign-Up Form</h4>
                        </div>
                        <div class="modal-input">
                            <label class="visually-hidden" for="modal-full-name">Full Name</label>
                            <input type="text" class="form-control" id="modal-full-name" aria-label="full-name"
                                name="modal-full-name" placeholder="Full Name" required>
                        </div>
                        <div class="modal-input">
                            <label class="visually-hidden" for="modal-email">Email address</label>
                            <input type="email" class="form-control" id="modal-email" aria-label="email-address"
                                name="modal-email" placeholder="Email address" required>
                        </div>
                        <button type="submit" class="btn btn--orange" data-dismiss="modal">Submit</button>
                    </form>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

    <!-- .customized modal from Bootstrap/Whiskey Drop Module -->

```

The problem with this code is in the 3rd div from top. I had removed the class name "modal-content" and replaced it with "modal-container".
After looking through documentation on Bootstrap, I finally realized this mistake.

3. Button Styled Calls to Action
    * Originally, the button styled calls to action were anchor tags wrapping button tags, rather than pure CSS styled anchor tags
    * This caused display issues on Internet Explorer, and was flagged as an error by W3C HTML Validator
    * I resolved by deleting out the button tags on every page, and using CSS to style the anchor tags appropriately.

4. Image size
    * Originally on generating a Lighthouse report on my deployed page, it returned a performance rating of 30%
    * I had used png files instead of jpg out of concern for image quality
    * However, these files considerable slowed the load time of the website. So I converted all image files except the logo.
